# histtune

Histtune is my final project of the course *Wunderbare Welt der musikalischen Akustik: Synthese* at the *University of Vienna*.

It lets you explore historical tuning systems and compare them with our usual *equal temperament* by playing examples.
The major point is, however, that it is a full MIDI player, where you can play your own MIDI files in a chosen temperament.
